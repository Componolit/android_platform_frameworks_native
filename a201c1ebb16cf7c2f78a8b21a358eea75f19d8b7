      "message": "Yeah.\nWill an fsync on the service ensure that the data is read here? There is no other way I can think of from lshal to know the data is fully read, without kernel changes (which are still pending).\nThis is better than just closing directly because it will read a little bit more data. At least, in the old code, lshal debug sometimes emits no result at all. Now, it writes correctly and much more reliably.",

If it times out assume it\u0027d have hung and exit the loop manually. It\u0027s still a hack though. It\u0027s worrying that these file descriptors are just \"stuck\" somewhere.",
