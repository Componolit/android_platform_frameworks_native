      "message": "This is to handle the AIBinder_DeathRecipient case, but where the AIBinder is dropped by the client.\n\nThe removal of extra transfer death recipients happens in a way that ensures this doesn\u0027t grow without bounds.\n\n\nNote the reason why this can\u0027t happen in binderDied is because there is no way to go from wp\u003cIBinder\u003e to a weak pointer to AIBinder. The AIBinder object will always be a ABpBinder object in this case (and these objects compose rather than inherit IBinder). This composition is required since binder objects may be are created externally to libbinder_ndk.",
