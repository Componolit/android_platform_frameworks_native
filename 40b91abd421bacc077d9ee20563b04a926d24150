It\u0027s not stated in hwcomposer2.h, but in hwcomposer.h, we say:\n\n     * IMPORTANT NOTE: There is an implicit layer containing opaque black\n     * pixels behind all the layers in the list. It is the responsibility of\n     * the hwcomposer module to make sure black pixels are output (or blended\n     * from).\n\nWhile we don\u0027t specifically say it for HWC2, the expectation remains the same. As such, if the layer list is empty, we expect the screen to be black.",
