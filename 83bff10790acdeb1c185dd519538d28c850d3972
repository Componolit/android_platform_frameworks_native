      "message": "This isn\u0027t a use of libbinder though. Since it is a static dependency, all the shared dependencies are dropped. This seems like it is just a convenient way to only include the symbols from libstagefright_foundation which are needed for the APEX (and dropping all of the ones that actually depend on libbinder).\n\nDo we want to consider this case for apex_available? The important thing is that the libbinder symbols or library itself aren\u0027t in the APEX. I agree we should check this for correctness (we should even be checking headers, although they are such a mess in general), but in the meantime, this means com.android.media could start actually including libbinder in the APEX.\n\nWDYT?",
